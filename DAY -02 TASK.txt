1)Difference between Document and Windows object

Document Object:
-> The document object is the root node of the HTML document.
-> The document object is a property of the window object.
-> The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser.
-> By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
-> With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page.
-> The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document. 

Window Object:
-> The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
-> The window object represents an open window in a browser.
-> It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
-> Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 
-> If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, 
   and one additional window object for each frame.
